 ToDo For Next Release:
   ☐ [BUG] Editing an existing group's name creates a new group with new name and leaves old group there instead of replacing it
   ☐ user.seen_changelog isn't used anymore, we use local storage, maybe we should go back though because it syncs with the cloud and local doesn't

 Housekeeping:
   ☐ Update blurb - add example use cases (Github repo, Custom Chrome Github website, Chrome Web Store)
   ☐ Update screenshots (same places as blurb)
   ✔ Reply to Chrome Web Store reviews/feedback @done (18-04-29 19:37)
   ☐ Post on Reddit
   ☐ 

Future Features:
   ☐ display profile tooltips vertically (have tried <br> "\n" "&lt;br /&gt;" "&#013;")
   ☐ change search icon colour on when focusing on search input
   ☐ import/export (as json) button on groups
   ☐ add numbered badge to Groups
   ☐ if an extension is in the inactive list because it needs increased permissions then visually show that to the user next to the extension (chrome.management ExtensionDisabledReason "permissions_increase")
   ☐ IFTTT - IF I'm on Reddit THEN turn on RES automatically
   ☐ advanced option to see memory usage of each extension (next to switch)
   ☐ have an option to make sure certain extensions are off when using a profile e.g. turn off ad blockers and social blockers when using "Web Dev" profile but record their state before the change and re-instate it after profile is turned off
   ☐ extension alerts when an extension has been sold, has malware, has vulnerabilities etc. (chrome.management ExtensionInfo "version")
   ☐ do not show an on/off switch if the app can't be disabled/uninstalled by the user (chrome.management ExtensionInfo "mayDisable")
   ☐ 
   ☐
